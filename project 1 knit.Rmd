## Introduction
- Suicide is a global phenomenon and occurs throughout the lifespan. Effective and evidence-based intervention can implement population. Suicide is a complex issue and therefore suicide prevention efforts need to collaboration among multiple aspects and other sectors such as society, mental business, justice. These efforts must be comprehensive and become broader over worldwide. 
- Data from this project carried out to investigate the relationship between the suicide number and the population of each country and by gender. By using the additional data of the facilities, the variable of health unit and mental hospital shown the inversely proportional to the suicide number variable by each country.
- This project is make an overall analysis of suicide rate and explain these rate in detail by dyplyr and PCA.

*My main point in this research is focus on the suicide number of population in 2016 and how the facilities such as mental hospital and health unit effects on the number of suicide by each country. Thus, my dataset have been drop 9 variable include country-year','HDI_for_year','outpatient_facilities','residential_facilities' ,'day_treatment','gdp_for_year($)','gdp_per_capita($)','suicides/100k_pop' after combining two dataset.*


## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r }
#explore the suicide_tidy dataset by dplyr function
# Summarize data by finding the mean suicide_no, number of rows, and number of distinct (country)
suicide_tidy %>%
   summarize(mean(suicides_no, na.rm=T), # calculate mean by ignoring NA values
            n(), # number of rows
            n_distinct(country))
# Summarize data by finding the mean population, number of rows, and number of distinct (country)
suicide_tidy %>%
   summarize(mean(population, na.rm=T), # calculate mean by ignoring NA values
            n(), # number of rows
            n_distinct(country))
# Summarize data by finding the mean mental_hospitals, number of rows, and number of distinct (country)
suicide_tidy %>%
   summarize(mean(mental_hospitals, na.rm=T), # calculate mean by ignoring NA values
            n(), # number of rows
            n_distinct(country))
# Summarize data by finding the mean mental_hospitals, number of rows, and number of distinct (country)
suicide_tidy %>%

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
